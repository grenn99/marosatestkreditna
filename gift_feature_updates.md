# Gift Feature Updates

## Database Changes

### Fixed Type Mismatch in Orders Table

The `gift_product_id` column in the `orders` table had a type mismatch issue. It was defined as an INTEGER type but needed to reference the `id` column in the `products` table, which is a TEXT type. This has been fixed with the following changes:

1. Created a migration script (`supabase/migrations/20240503_fix_gift_product_id_type.sql`) that:
   - Checks if the `gift_product_id` column exists and its current type
   - If the column is of INTEGER type, changes it to TEXT type
   - Adds the foreign key constraint to reference the `products` table
   - Ensures `gift_product_package_id` and `gift_product_cost` columns exist with the correct types

2. Updated the checkout process to properly use these columns:
   - Modified `CheckoutPage.tsx` to store gift-related information directly in the database columns instead of just in the notes field
   - Ensured `gift_product_id` is stored as a string to match the TEXT column type

## How to Apply the Changes

1. Run the migration script to fix the database schema:
   ```bash
   ./run_gift_product_id_migration.sh
   ```

2. The application code has been updated to use the correct column types, so no additional changes are needed.

## Testing

After applying these changes, you should test the gift functionality by:

1. Adding a gift product to the cart
2. Completing the checkout process
3. Verifying that the gift information is correctly stored in the database
4. Checking that the gift information is displayed correctly in the order details

## Future Improvements

1. Enhance the gift recipient address handling by storing it in a dedicated table instead of in the order notes
2. Add more comprehensive gift management features to the admin panel
3. Improve the gift selection and customization flow for better user experience
